# Minimum Number of Perfect Squares to Sum to N

## Problem Description
You are given a positive integer `n`. Your task is to determine the smallest number of perfect
square numbers that sum exactly to `n`.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer (e.g., `1, 4, 9, 16, ...`).

This problem requires finding the minimum count of perfect squares whose sum equals `n`.  
The same perfect square can be used multiple times if necessary.

## Scenario
Imagine you’re a cashier with coins whose values are only perfect squares (`1, 4, 9, 16, ...`).
You have to give change for an amount `n` using the **fewest coins possible**.  
Your goal is to figure out the minimum number of coins you need.

## Input Format
- A single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4)

## Output Format
- A single integer — the minimum number of perfect squares whose sum equals `n`.

---

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4
- You can use any perfect square as many times as needed.
